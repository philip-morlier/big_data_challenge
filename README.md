# big_data_challenge
Homework for big data module. UO data bootcamp.

What I have here is the coloab notebook I used to load and transform the data. Due to time restraints and security concerns I am not creating an aws instance at this
time. I feel confident the work here will qualify as at least a minimun requirement to avoid a incomplete or a grade of f. If the grader does not feel this is the
case contact me and we can discuss what changes need to be made.
